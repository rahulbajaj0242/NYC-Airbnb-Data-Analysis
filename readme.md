# NYC Airbnb Data Analysis

This project analyzes NYC Airbnb data to answer the following questions:

- What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?
- How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?
- How many adverts are for private rooms?
- How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?

## Data

The data used in this project is sourced from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). The dataset used is the "Detailed Listings Data" for NYC, which includes information on Airbnb listings in NYC, such as price, location, and availability.

## Methodology

The project uses Python, mainly NumPy and Pandas, to clean and manipulate the data to get insights. The data cleaning process includes removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and converting data types. The data manipulation process includes grouping data by relevant variables, calculating summary statistics, and visualizing the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Results

The analysis reveals the following insights:

- The average price of an Airbnb listing in NYC is $141.82 per night or $4313.61 per month 
- The average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, is generally higher than the private rental market.
- Approximately 45% of Airbnb listings in NYC are for private rooms.
- Airbnb listing prices vary significantly across the five NYC boroughs, with Manhattan having the highest average price per night.

## Conclusion

The project provides valuable insights into the NYC Airbnb market, including average prices, private room listings, and borough-level price comparisons. The insights can be used by potential Airbnb hosts and renters to make informed decisions about pricing and location. The project also demonstrates the use of Python, NumPy, and Pandas for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
